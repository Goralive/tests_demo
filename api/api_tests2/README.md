## Automation with Python Requests vs. Postman Newman

### Python Requests:
- **Flexibility:** Python Requests provides a high level of flexibility and control over HTTP requests. You can easily customize headers, authentication, and data payloads.
- **Integration:** Python Requests can be integrated into larger Python automation frameworks, allowing for seamless integration with other parts of your automation pipeline.
- **Complexity:** Writing and maintaining automation scripts with Python Requests may require more code and effort compared to using a tool like Postman Newman.

### Postman Newman:
- **Ease of Use:** Postman Newman is designed for API testing and automation, making it easier to set up and run API tests compared to writing scripts with Python Requests.
- **Environment Management:** Postman provides features for managing environments and variables, which can be helpful for testing in different environments.
- **Reporting:** Postman Newman can generate detailed test reports, which can be useful for tracking test results and identifying issues.

In general, if you're already familiar with Python and want more control over your automation scripts, Python Requests may be a better choice. On the other hand, if you prefer a tool that is specifically designed for API testing and offers features like environment management and reporting, Postman Newman could be more suitable.
